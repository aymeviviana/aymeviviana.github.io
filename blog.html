        <p>Ruby classes are especially useful when solving really, really big problems. The larger the scale of the problem, the more you find yourself needing order. Ruby classes provide this organization by grouping together related methods which helps to reduce the occurrence of redundant code . . .</p>

        <p>A simple google search for "biggest problems in the tech industry" will immediately flood your results page with report after report of the severe talent gap that tech recruiters wrestle with every day. The search for ways to find and hire qualified programmers in the Silicon Valley has been a years-long, industry-wide challenge . . .</p>

        <p>Overall, pair programming has been a hugely positive for me, which definitely took me by surprise. I was never one to get excited about a group project or meeting new people each school year. My preference to work solo made me actively avoid these things...for as long as humanly possible. This is precisely why it's been such a pleasant surprise to enjoy the experience of pairing with complete strangers to solve legitimately difficult problems.</p>

        <p>I've been curious about the word "enumerable" ever since I picked up my first Ruby tutorial. Ruby-docs and I don't get along very well so it wasn't a very good place to go to get this question answered. Luckily I found Erik Trautman's brilliant blog and finally came across a readable, human-friendly explanation of the word "Enumerable" . . .</p>
