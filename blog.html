        <p class="date">04.20.2015</p>
        <p>The urge to improve a  website is ever-present, especially when its yours. I recently pushed out huge overhaul of my blog design and structure, and the experiece reminded me that before opening up your site files you should always have three things lined up . . .</p>

        <a href="blog/ruby-class-attributes.html">The Long-Term Value Of Ruby Class Attributes</a>
        <p class="date">04.18.2015</p>
        <p>Ruby attribute readers and writers are handy short-hand for instance variables, but unless you've written a long, complex ruby class that you've changed and maintained over a long period of time it might be difficult to see the value in using attributes.</p>

        <a href="blog/t8-tech.html">The Internet: A Network Of Networks</a>
        <p class="date">04.16.2015</p>
        <p>The word "internet" came from the idea that two computers communicating with one another formed a network. If two separate computers can communicate with each other then you have two networks. Finally if you can find a way for all 4 computers to play by the same rules and communicate with one another then you have an inter network, or the internet.</p>

        <p class="date">04.10.2015</p>
        <p>Last week I posted about an experience where stereotype threat had a negative impact on my performance. Now we're going to explore opportunities to battle stereotype threat through repeated affirmation of one's values.</p>

        <p class="date">04.09.2015</p>
        <p>I remember taking the CodeCademy JavaScript track last August. The experience was intesely fulfilling. It was the first programming language I'd ever learned. Of course there were several moments where my brow would suddenly (and aggressively) wrinkle and I felt an overwhelming wave of frustration wash over me. I remember feeling like my brain was crying inside my skull.</p>

        <a href="blog/t6-oop-concepts.html">Classes vs. Modules</a>
        <p class="date">04.02.2015</p>
        <p>We’re already familiar with classes from last week's Hogwarts post. A ruby class is a structure that groups together related methods and variables for the sake of organization and reduced code-redundancy. To complement our knowledge of classes we’ll now learn about Modules.</p>

        <a href="#">You Drive</a>
        <p class="date">04.01.2015</p>
        <p>Let me just start by saying that I am a fantastic driver. I drive like a boss. In fact, I've got the kind of parallel parking skills that make heads turn. No San Francisco parking spot is to small for me to safely squeeze into and I've got a pile of car insurance discounts from years of good driving. But no matter how true these things might be, I frequently feel the need to hand the keys over to a guy if there's a man in the car.</p>

        <a href="blog/c5-feedback.html">Pairing &amp; Feedback</a>
        <p class="date">03.26.2015</p>
        <p>Overall pair programming has been a net positive for me, which has definitely taken me by surprise. I was never one to get excited about a group project or meeting new people each school year. My preference to work solo made me actively avoid these things...for as long as humanly possible. This is precisely why it's been such a pleasant surprise to enjoy the experience of pairing with complete strangers to solve legitimately difficult problems.</p>

        <a href="blog/t5-ruby-classes.html">Ruby Classes For Hogwarts!</a>
        <p class="date">03.26.2015</p>
        <p>Ruby Classes are especially useful when solving really, really big problems. The larger the scale of the problem, the more you find yourself needing order. Ruby classes provide this organization by grouping together related methods which helps to reduce the occurrence of redundant code.</p>

        <p class="date">03.19.2015</p>
        <p>A google search for "biggest problems in the tech industry" will flood your results page with report after report about the severe talent gap that tech recruiters wrestle with every day. The search for ways to find and hire qualified programmers in the Silicon Valley has been a years-long, industry-wide challenge.</p>

        <p class="date">03.19.2015</p>
        <p>#cycle is an iterator, like #each or #collect, that cycles over an object over and over again until you tell it to stop.</p>

        <a href="blog/ruby-enumerable-methods.html">10 Useful Enumerable Methods</a>
        <p class="date">03.13.2015</p>
        <p>I've been curious about the word "enumerable" ever since I picked up my first Ruby tutorial. Ruby-docs and I don't get along very well so it wasn't a very good place to go to get this question answered. Luckily I found Erik Trautman's blog and finally came across a readable, human-friendly explanation of the word "Enumerable".</p>

        <a href="blog/c3-thinking-style.html">Thinking Style: Concrete Sequential &amp; Concrete Random</a>
        <p class="date">03.12.2015</p>
        <p>According to Anthony Gregorc's theory on thinking styles, my style leans strongly toward the Concrete Sequential category, with Concrete Random coming in a close second. And after looking at the description of strengths and weaknesses for Concrete Sequential thinkers I strongly agree with my assessment. Surpringly, I think the results are pretty spot on in my case.</p>

        <a href="blog/t3-arrays-hashes.html">Ruby Lists: Arrays &amp; Hashes</a>
        <p class="date">03.12.2015</p>
        <p>Hashes and Arrays are Ruby's version of lists. They are used to store information in an orderly, list-like fashion. For example, if you were to write down all the ingredients for your delicious taco dinner your list might look something like this. . .</p>

        <p class="date">03.06.2015</p>
        <p>There are some specific rules to be aware of before using CSS's display property. Knowing when to use inline, block or inline-block is a lot easier when you understand how each value responds to other properties like margin, padding, height &amp; width. Take a look at the diagrams below for a quick breakdown of each value's behavior. We'll assume the squares below are div's.</p>

        <p class="date">02.26.2015</p>
        <p>I was originally only going to watch pieces of the fireside chat since it was over an hour long, but once it got going I couldn't pause or skip ahead. The way Shereef described the DBC experience was very exciting and motivating to me.</p>

        <p>This week's challenges were focused on setting up a collaborative programming environment (GitHub), managing the changes each programmer makes within that environment (Git) and how to communicate direclty with your computer in order to enact changes to your project (Command Line).</p>
