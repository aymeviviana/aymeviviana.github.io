## 4. Open Source and Repo Setup  Reflection

* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person
* Describe what open source means
* What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
* Assess the importance of using licenses
* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

Creating a respository in GitHub is very simple. The easiest way is to click the plus icon on the top right corner of your github account. You can find it next to your username. You can also open up a new repository by going into your Repositories tab and clicking the green button on the right hand side that says "New". From there you simply name your repository, select your privacy settings, select the README option, decided whether or not to add a license and click "Create Repository".

If a project is open source it means that 1) the creator has made the project code available and accessible to the public and 2) The public is free to customize the code however they wish. Personally, I can see the value in opening up a project to a community of passionate, talented programmers, but I wouldn't enter that world without caution. Getting familiar with licensing seems like a wise thing to do before sharing your projects publicly. When you open source your project without licensing you're basically allowing anyone to come in and do whatever they wish with your code, whether that includes modifying it, distributing it or selling it so it's important to decide what parameters you're comfortable with and what kind of licensing makes sense for you before you open source your project. 

During this challenge I appreciated getting more practice with cloning, committing and pushing changes. These seem like basic functions I'll be needing frequently so the extra practice really helps. I also feel like the term "open source" was demistified. The short, to-the-point articles on open source were very clean and helpful in understanding this concept.
