# U1.W1: Thinking About Time Reflection

I’m a list-maker. Currently my time is managed by Asana task lists. I have a “Daily Tasks” list that includes recurring tasks (i.e. working out, picking up groceries and checking in with parents) as well as one-off tasks (i.e. meeting up with friends and making amazon orders). This method didn’t always work, I had to find the discipline to stick to it, but once I found my groove I couldn’t start my day without looking at Asana first. 

For the “Thinking About Time” challenge I looked into “setting smaller goals,” inspired by BufferSocial. Approaching big goals by starting small really appealed to me because it helps remove a lot of the intimidation that comes along with pursuing big milestones. The discussion on “starting small” actually lines up nicely with how I started on the path towards becoming a developer. I never said “I’m going to become a programmer”, I started by focusing on learning something I was interested in (HTML/CSS on codecademy). A few months later that interest unexpectedly snowballed into the much bigger goal of signing up for DBC and changing my career path. 

I thought this Forbes article did a really good job of describing the approach with this quote: “If your goal is to lose 50 lbs, turn it into eat one healthy breakfast this week. If your goal is to start a business, change it to ‘interview one business owner’ ”. In doing so you can score some easy wins and boost your confidence on your way to accomplishing your bigger goal. 

I think I’ll employ the “setting smaller goals” approach by breaking up each week’s curriculum into small, bite-size tasks in Asana and tackling them one at a time. 

My overall plan for time management during Phase 0 is to have daily, scheduled coding hours. During this time my phone will be off, and all internet distractions (facebook, reddit, etc) will be blocked off using the “StayFocusd” chrome extension.
