# 1: Command Line Reflection

Write your reflection on a document or by hand on the following questions. Keep track of your answers because you'll be asked to add them to this document in challenge [6: Tracking Changes](../6-tracking-changes).

- What is a shell? What is "bash?"
- What was the most challenging for you in going through this material?
- Were you able to successfully use all of the commands?
- In your opinion, what are the most important arguments to know?
- Can you remember what each of the following does of the top of your head? 

A shell is an intermediary that facilitates communication between users (i.e. humans) and the computer’s operating system (UNIX). A shell takes user inputs and commands and translates them into instructions that can be processed by UNIX and then returns UNIX’s output in a way that the user can understand. Bash is a type of shell.

The most challenging part of this material was reading and understanding both bash chapters. There was a lot of terminology that I’m still struggling to define in my head (i.e. operating system, shell, bash, terminal, command line). Understanding bash was difficult because I found the reading material to be so abstract.

Luckily I was able to use and understand all the commands in the command line crash course. Tons of memorization will need to happen in the following days in order to really feel comfortable using Terminal. I found that the commands I used the most were: pwd, cd and ls because I was constantly having to navigate between directories and see what was inside them.

- pwd	    prints out the current directory you are in
- ls		  lists all the files and directories that exist within the current directory
- grep	  searches for specific information within a file
- mv		  moves or renames a file or directory
- cd		  allows you to change directories
- ../	    allows you to move up a directory
- touch   creates an new, empty file
- mkdir   creates a new directory
- echo	  i forgot this one but I looked it up...prints arguments
- less	  displays the contents of a file
- rmdir 	removes a directory
- cat	    displays the contents of a file directly within the same shell
- rm		  removes a file
- help	  (UNIX version is man) allows you to lookup the definition and application of any command
- exit	  allows you to logout of your current shell
