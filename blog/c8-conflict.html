      <h1>Dealing With Conflict</h1>
      <h4>April 16, 2015</h4>
      <p>A long time ago I privately told my boss about the overwhelming anxiety I felt every time I had to give a presentation or speak in front of an audience. It was difficult to admit but it felt like a huge weight off my shoulders to reveal it to someone else.</p>

      <p>Weeks later I was scheduled to present a quarterly progress report in front of the company’s leadership team. I was dreading it. When the day arrived my presentation was unexpectedly canceled because all presenters before me went longer than expected. I was partially relieved but also highly frustrated that I’d wasted so much time and hadn’t gotten to follow through.</p>

      <p>Later that day a co-worker who’d been present at the meeting mentioned that my boss had jokingly told everyone that I was lucky to be skipped because I was afraid to present.</p>

      <p>I felt embarrassed, exposed and feverishly angry. I felt paralyzed by humiliation for hours. When I finally calmed down I realized that I was so angry because in the eyes of the company’s leaders I was now labeled as the girl who was afraid. Now that this information was out there I felt like convincing others that I was a confident, reliable leader was going to be much harder. I felt unfairly pigeon-holed.</p>

      <p>I wasn’t in the room when he said it so I never really knew the context in which it was said, but that didn’t stop me from writing a rather incendiary email to my then boss. I told him how the news of his commentary made me feel and how I felt it belittled me in front of the company’s highest ranking leaders. Unfortunately, my tone was very pointed. His response made it clear that he never had any malicious intent and he was incredibly apologetic about the whole thing.</p>

      <p>I felt horrible for letting my anger get the best of me. In retrospect I never should have let myself respond to the situation while I was still so upset. I should have waited until I’d cooled off and approached him honestly, and with kindness, the next day.</p>
