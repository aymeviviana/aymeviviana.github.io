      <h1>Reactions to Fireside Chat With Shereef</h1>
      <h4>Februrary 26, 2015</h4>

      <p>I was originally only going to watch pieces of the fireside chat since it was over an hour long, but once it got going I couldn't pause or skip ahead. The way Shereef described the DBC experience was very exciting and motivating to me.</p>

      <h3>"We're all in this together"</h3>
      <p>From the beginning Shereef set expectations very clearly. It seems like the spirit of the program is very collaborative rather than competitive. I really liked the metaphor he used to explain why we shouldn't let differences in knowledge intimidate us. He said something like "We're all walking from San Francisco to Seattle together. Some people are starting at the beginning and some are 100 steps ahead." To me that made it clear that we should expect everyone else to have a different level of expertise, but it doesn't matter because we're taking a much bigger journey together.</p>

      <h3>"Programming is like architecting a building"</h3>
      <p>I looooved the analogy Shereef used to explain that DBC's goal is to turn its students into great engineers rather than specialists in XYZ language. I often worry about how the languages I learn will impact my employment opportunities but Shereef's take on the importance of learning how to build over the importance of learning any specific language was very englightening.</p>

      <h3>Overall Impression</h3>
      <p>The impression I got was that DBC is a very collaborative, experiemental, get-your-hands-dirty type of environment where you should put in every effort to take control of your education in order to succeed. I think this will be a great cultural fit for me. I learn best by doing and I need a supportive, collaborative environment in order to learn. That said, I don't think the video changed any of my expectations because I'd gotten this same impression of DBC back when I first applied. The video certainly did motivate me though. It helped put me in the right mindset to approach this experience as a huge experiment and to be aggressive about getting as much as I can out of it.</p>


      <h3>One thing I'm nervous about...</h3>
      <p>My main concern about DBC has always been about pairing. Shereef touched on this during the chat and made a really good point about how pairing helps build the kind of interpersonal skills companies look for. I'm definitely and introvert and it can be very taxing to meet new people and work in groups. At this age I've come to accept that it's going to be a lifetime struggle so I just have to take it one step at a time and fake it 'till I make it.</p>

      <p>The idea of pairing every day certainly raises certain anxieties in me. I wouldn't say I'm bad at working with others, I just have to deal with a certain level of fear before meeting a new person or working on a group project, but I'm commited to rolling with the punches until it gets easier.</p>
