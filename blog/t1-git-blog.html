      <h1>Week 1: GitHub, Git &amp; The Command Line</h1>
      <h4>February 26, 2015</h4>

      <p>This week's challenges were focused on setting up a collaborative programming environment (GitHub), managing the changes each programmer makes within that environment (Git) and how to communicate direclty with your computer in order to enact changes to your project (Command Line).</p>

      <h3>GitHub</h3>
      <p>In my mind it makes most sense to start with GitHub. Think of GitHub as a place. Deverlopers go to GitHub to store their program files and enable other deverlopers to access and modify those files. It's kind of like a large storage wherehouse made up of a bunch of small storage rooms. Anyone can come claim a storage room (Repository) and drop off their personal items (program files).</p> 

      <p>The cool thing about GitHub is that anyone (usually your project collaborators) can easily access your files and make changes without having to physically travel to your computer to change up some code. Once your program files are uploaded to GitHub, your team members only need an internet connection to access your files and get to work. This set up makes it possible for developers scattered all over the world to work on the same project.  
      </p>

      <h3>Git</h3>
      <p>But what happens when you all start making changes to the same files at the same time? This is where Git comes in. Git is responsible for version control, which basically means that it keeps track of all changes made by all collaborators. Each time a collaborator makes a change to the project the change is saved in a log and displays details like: who commited the change, what exactly was changed and an explanation about why the change was commited. Each of these changes can then be reviewed by a different team member and pushed out to the live site once the changes are approved. These types of "save points" give collaborators reassurance that they can track down the cause of a bug and revert to an old version of the site in the event that something breaks.</p>

      <h3>Command Line</h3>
      <p>And finally there's the command line. There are many different ways to make changes to a website and the command line is just one of them. It allows you to speak directly to your computer and give it commands such as creating a new file or directory, copying a file or pushing code changes to your live website. Getting the hang of navigating through the command line is kind of like learning a new language itself, but its pretty powerful once you nail down the most commonly used commands.<p>
