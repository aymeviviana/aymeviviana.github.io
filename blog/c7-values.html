      <h1>Combating Stereotype Threat With Affirmation</h1>
      <p class="date">04.10.2015</p>
      <p>Last week I posted about an experience where stereotype threat had a negative impact on my performance. Now we're going to explore opportunities to battle stereotype threat through repeated affirmation of one's values.</p>

      <h3>Step 1. Explore Your Values</h3>

      <p>Think about the times in your life you've felt the happiest and most satisfied. Which values created that sense of fulfillment for you?</p>

      <p><span class="highlight">Ayme:</span> Some of the moments in my life where I remember feeling really happy and fulfilled include A solo performance I gave as part of my 7th grade orchestra class when I was 12 years old, when I graduated college and when I quit my job to spend 9 months traveling throughout Europe and Asia.</p>

      <p>The values that I think were reinforced by these experiences were passion, accomplishment, committment, freedom and adventure.</p>

      <p>My first love was my viola. I never wanted to play a string instrument, I wanted to play the clarinet. But when the viola fell into my lap I fell completely in love. I practiced every day and learned the toughest pieces because it was so much fun. When I gave the solo performance in front of my school and parents I felt so happy to have gotten over my stage fright in the interest of sharing my passion with everyone else.</p>

      <p>When I graduated from college I felt like a huge weight had been lifted off my shoulders. I felt like an impostor all throughout college and at times firmly believed I wouldn't get through. Graduation day was a huge relief. I was so happy to have stuck to my committment and see it through to the end.</p>

      <p>Last year when I left my job to do some serious travel I felt like I was going on a real adventure for the first time in my life. Putting the worry and risk aside in favor of seeing out a new lifestyle made me feel truly free.</p>

      <h3>Step 2: Evaluate How Much You Follow Your Values</h3>
      <p>On a scale from 1 to 5 (1 being "disagree" and 5 being "agree"), how much do you try to live up to your values?<p>

      <p><span class="highlight">Ayme:</span></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Passion: 2</li>
        <li>Accomplishment: 4</li>
        <li>Committment: 5</li>
        <li>Freedom: 4</li>
        <li>Adventure: 3</li>
      </ul>
     <h3>Step 3: Examine Why Are These Values Are Important To You</h3>
     <p>Pick a value and examine why it's important to you.</p>
     <p><span class="highlight">Ayme:</span> Freedom has recently become a very important value for me, specifically with regards to being able to make my own choices, free from the opinions of others.</p>

     <p>To be clear, the people around me have always been very supportive and encouraging of the decisions I make for myself. The feeling that I'm lacking freedom has always been rooted in my need for approval of others. This need often leads me to feel like I should live my life the way other people do.</p>

     <p>Last year when I decided to throw convention out the window and quit my job to spend my savings traveling around the world I found myself feeling completely free for the first time in my life. The distance I put between myself and the routine I'd followed throughout my 20's helped me filter out a lot of noise. I no longer felt like I needed to have a certain job, salary or financial status in order to be happy. I realized that I could redefine my life at any time, according to the values that I felt were important. Giving myself the freedom to change up my lifestyle really helped solidify that perspective for me.</p>

     <h3>Step 4: Consider The Times Someone Has Asked Your For Advice</h3>
     <p>What was the last topic someone asked you for advice on and how did it relate to your values?</p>

     <p><span class="highlight">Ayme:</span> A few weeks ago my mom asked me what she could do to make fish taste better. She hates fish but recognizes their health benefits so she was looking for a way to ease them into her diet.</p>

     <p>I'm no health expert. I love eating chilli cheese fries until my body feels like it's going to break down, but I do make an effort to eat healthier now that I'm no longer 16 and flaming hots don't seem to give me the energy they once did.</p>

     <p>I think the discussion I had with my mom was definitely about committment. It's important to me to stick to my committments because it forced me to think critically about what I'm willing to commit to. I also appreciate when I can rely on the committments that others have made to me, which is why I take this particular value so seriously. The committments we make to ourselves and others aren't always fun and exciting, they're often a drag and require discipline. When we don't stick to our committments we disappoint ourselves, others and we miss out on an opportunity to grow.</p>
     <p>In this case my mom was trying to commit to a healthier diet and I was enthusiastic to help her because even though it'll be hard for her to accomplish it, the reward will outweight the cost.</p>

     <h3>Step 5: Affirm Your Values</h3>
     <p>Practice affirming your values when you feel stereotype threat is present.</p>
     <p>I think in addition to affirming your values, you can combat forces like stereotype threat by recalling previous experiences when you had success and regard those memories as proof of your abilities.</p>
     <p>I also like to practice "zooming-out" whenever I'm wrestling a group of negative emotions. Whenever I'm angry, frustrated, or feeling depresed about anything I like to remind myself to pretend like I'm looking at myself from 5 miles in the air. This usually helps me get a broader perspective on the situation and realize that getting caught up in negativity is entirely pointless...I also zoom-out by pretending I'm back in the south of Spain drinking wine on a hill while watching the sun set. That usually does the trick.</p>
