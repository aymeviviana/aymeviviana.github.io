      <h1>Before You Update Your Website...</h1>
      <p class="date">04.20.2015</p>
      <p>The urge to improve a  website is ever-present, especially when its yours. I recently published an updated version of my blog design and structure, and the experiece reminded me that before opening up your site files you should always have these three things lined up...</p>

      <h3>1) A Clearly Defined List Of Items To Update</h3>
      <p>Take the time to write down the specific things you want to change about your site so that you can approach your update with some direction rather than wasting a bunch of time experimenting with features that aren't very urgent.</p>
      <h3>2) A Pre-Determined Amount Of Time To Spend On Those Updates</h3>
      <p>If I let myself, I'll sink 10 straight ours into my site. This is ridiculous. There's no need to do that. Think about the amount of time it will take to complete your updates and then divide that time by 2. Put yourself under the gun a little bit in order to avoid sinking huge unnecessary amounts of time into your project.</p>
      <h3>3) The Expectation That Numbers 1 and 2 WILL Grow Longer</h3>
      <p>I gave myself 5 hours for my recent blog update and I ended up taking 6. That's pretty close to my original goal, but not great considering I'd been generous with the time I'd alotted myself for the list of changes I had in mind. The lesson is: it'll always take longer than you think, so be prepared for that.</p>
