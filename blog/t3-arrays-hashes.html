      <h1>Ruby Lists: Arrays &amp; Hashes</h1>
      <h4>March 12, 2015</h4>

      <h3>What Are Arrays &amp; Hashes?</h3>
      <p>Hashes and Arrays are Ruby's version of lists. They are used to store information in an orderly, list-like fashion. For example, if you were to write down all the ingredients for your delicious taco dinner your list might look something like this:</p>
      <strong>Grocery List</strong>
      <ol>
      	<li>Tortillas</li>
      	<li>Chicken</li>
      	<li>Avocado</li>
      	<li>Beans</li>
      	<li>Lemons</li>
      	<li>Onions</li>
      	<li>Cilantro</li>
      	<li>Salsa</li>
      	<li>Beer</li>
      </ol>

      <p>If we were to translate that list to Ruby it would look like this:</p>

      <pre><code>grocery_list = ["Tortillas", "Chicken", "Avocado", "Beans", "Lemons", "Onions", "Cilantro", "Salsa", "Beer"]</code></pre>
      <p>A simple list of ingredients wrapped in double quotes and separated by commas. A Hash can be thought of as a slightly more sophisticated array list. Hashes, like arrays, are lists of information, with the major difference being that Hashes allow you to give each item on the list a name, kind of like a categorization system. If we took our grocery list from above and translated it into a Ruby hash it would look something like this:</p>

      <pre><code>grocery_list = {

grain: "Tortillas",
meat: "Chicken",
legume: "Beans",
fruit_1: "Avocado",
fruit_2: "Lemmons",
topping: "Salsa",
vegetable_1: "Cilantro",
vegetable_2: "Onion",
drink: "Beer"

}</code></pre>

	   <p>You'll notice the hash format looks very different from the array but the structure isn't all that different when you take a close look at it. The major difference is the addition of the labels to the left of the colon (these are called keys) which can simply be thought of as names for their corresponding ingredients to the right of the colon.</p>

	  <h3>Why Use Arrays Or Hashes?</h3>
	  <p>These data structures (or ruby lists) make it easy to group a set of related data under the same name, in this case "Grocery List". The alternative would be to assign a name to each individual ingredient, and that would be tedious and highly unwelcome.</p>
	  <h3>Updating Your Array Or Hash</h3>
	  <p>What good would a grocery list be if you couldn't add or cross off items while shopping? Modifying your Ruby array or hash can be done in a variety of different ways. Here are a few easy ways to make adjustments to both types of lists:</p>
	  <strong>Arrays</strong>
	  <pre><code>To add a new item to the end of the list: grocery_list.push("Cheese")</code></pre>
	  <pre><code>To cross-out (or remove) "Beans" from the list: grocery_list.delete("Cheese")</code></pre>
	  <strong>Hashes</strong>
	  <pre><code>To add a new key/value pair to a hash: grocery_list[:dairy] = "Cheese"</code></pre>
	  <pre><code>To cross-out (or remove) "Beans" from the list: grocery_list.delete(:legume)</code></pre>
