      <h1>You Drive</h1>
      <p class="date">04.01.2015</p>
      <p>Let me just start by saying that I am a fantastic driver. I drive like a boss. In fact, I've got the kind of parallel parking skills that make heads turn. No San Francisco parking spot is to small for me to safely squeeze into and I've got a pile of car insurance discounts from years of good driving. But no matter how true these things might be, I frequently feel the need to hand the keys over to a guy if there's a man in the car.</p>

      <p>To this day I hear men joke about womens' driving abilities. I've heard men close to me say things like "female drivers..." while shaking their heads after seeing a woman make a mistake on the road. Sometimes these comments are clearly jokes and other times the seem to come from a place of genuine belief that women are bad drivers.</p>

      <p>In either case, the impact is significant. Claude Steele's research shows that "[Stereotype Threat] can lead to self-handicapping strategies, such as reduced practice time for a task". I've seen this self-handicapping manifest itself in my tendency to ask a man to drive whenever the people in my car are predominantly male. I feel more  pressure to be on point when I'm driving my father and brothers than when I'm driving my mother or girlfriends. And I feel more embarassed when I make driving mistakes in front of men than when I mess up in front of women.</p>

      <p>Unfortunately I don't know what to do to shake it off. I know I'm a good driver and that I shouldn't feel inferior when driving in the presence of men, but I still do. It does, however, help to think that the next time someone drops an idiotic comment about female drivers, I'll promptly pull over and suggest they take an uber.</p>
