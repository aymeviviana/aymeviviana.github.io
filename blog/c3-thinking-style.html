      <h1>Concrete Sequential &amp; Concrete Random</h1>
      <h4>March 12, 2015</h4>
      <p>According to Anthony Gregorc's theory on thinking styles, my style leans strongly toward the Concrete Sequential category, with Concrete Random coming in a close second. And after looking at the description of strengths and weaknesses for Concrete Sequential thinkers I strongly agree with my assessment. Surpringly, I think the results are pretty spot on in my case.</p>
      <p>According to Gregorc's theory I am best equipped to learn whenever:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>I'm learning in a structure environment</li>
        <li>I can rely on others to complete their task</li>
        <li>I'm faced with predictable situations</li>
        <li>I can apply ideas in pragmatic ways</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Learning is difficult for me whenever:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>I have to work in groups</li>
        <li>I'm part of a discussion that seems to have no point</li>
        <li>I'm working with unpredictable people</li>
        <li>I'm dealing with abstract ideas</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I particularly agree with the assessment that my thinking style encounters difficulty when having to work in groups. My introversion consistently surfaces feelings of anxiety prior to commencing a pairing session. What's funny is that I've really enjoyed my pairing sessions and have learned A LOT about programming from my pairing partners, but there's still this nervous energy and internal-tension that arises because I know I have to continue working with others.</p> 

      <p>I think part of this problem is also rooted in the fact that I have difficulty working in unpredictable situations (as noted in my assessment above). I'm a control-freak. I have trouble letting go and not getting my way. I've never been a "go-with-the-flow" person. I'm more of a "plan-every-last-friggin-detail-to-death-until-i-drive-myself-and-everyone-else-around-me-crazy" type of person. I'm making myself sound like a lot of fun right now, aren't I?</p>

      <p>Inspite of all this, I have genuinely enjoyed working with my pairing partners during the last three weeks, and I have most definitely benefited from doing so. I should probably focus on this prior to a pairing session to counteract the seemingly unnecessary, but inevitable, anxiety. </p>
