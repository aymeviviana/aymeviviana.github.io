      <h1>Pairing &amp; Feedback</h1>
      <h4>March 26, 2015</h4>
      <p>Overall, pair programming has been a hugely positive for me, which definitely took me by surprise. I was never one to get excited about a group project or meeting new people each school year. My preference to work solo made me actively avoid these things...for as long as humanly possible. This is precisely why it's been such a pleasant surprise to enjoy the experience of pairing with complete strangers to solve legitimately difficult problems.</p>

      <h3>The Good</h3>
      <p>Pairing with other students has exposed me to a number of useful techniques and shortcuts I previously wasn't aware of. From small things like combining an "add" and "commit" on git with $git commit -am "Message" to using the return keyword properly. I learn something every time I pair with someone.</p>

      <p>I've also come to recognize the influence on bonding that problem solving can have on two complete strangers. I obviously never met any of the students I paired with, prior to pairing with them. When you stop to think about how weird that sounds, two strangers, meeting for the first time to solve a difficult problem, you might assume that it won't work out. Yet somehow the difficulty of the challenges helped bring the barriers down and helped us connect.</p>

      <h3>The Bad</h3>
      <p>At times, however, pairing can be difficult. I found that I had an easier time understanding the problem when I was navigating. Driving game me control over the keyboard but it also made me lose focus on the larger problem. While driving I always had a difficult time seeing down the road, all I could see was the line of code in front of me.</p>

      <p>Pairing can also be difficult when personalities aren't well matched, particularly when one or both parties are unwilling to concede control to the other person. Pairing is a much more productive and positive experience when both parties are willing listen to their their partner. This really helps faciliate experimentation which is what generally gets you closer to the solution.</p>

      <h3>The Feedback</h3>
      <p>Receiving feedback was definitely scary. It felt like I was opening up my report card all over again. I did, however, appreciate people's honesty. My pairs provided very helpful positive and constructive feedback that refinforced qualities I didn't know other people appreciated and shined a light on qualities that need some attention.</p>

      <p>Going forward I think I'll continue trying to maintain and calm demeanor while solving a difficult problem (because someone pointed out how much that helped them stay calm as well) and I'll take my time reading and understanding challenge directions to be a better navigator.</p>
