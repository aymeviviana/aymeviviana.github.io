      <h1>Can The Valley Close The Talent Gap?</h1>
      <h4>March 19, 2015</h4>
      <p>A simple google search for "biggest problems in the tech industry" will immediately flood your results page with report after report of the severe talent gap that tech recruiters wrestle with every day. The search for ways to find and hire qualified programmers in the Silicon Valley has been a years-long, industry-wide challenge.</p>

      <h3>What If We Outsource?</h3>
      <p>Outsourcing tech jobs to countries abroad is a popular alternative that the majority of startups and tech giants alike have adopted. Both tech companies I've worked for held the majority of their engineering teams in Ukraine and China.</p>
      <p>While this approach has certainly helped fill urgent job roles, it poses negative long-term effects to our economy at home and increases our dependency on countries abroad for our labor supply.</p>
      <h3>How About Lowering Immigration Barriers</h3>
      <p>Tech leaders like Google and Facebook have begun lobbying Washington to lower the immigration barriers for high-skill workers and relocate them to the U.S. If we can't fill the labor demand ourselves we can try luring talent from abroad. This strategy, however, is vulnerable because it relies on the assumption that the US will always be the leader in tech innovation. Poaching internationals will become increasingly difficult as countries abroad develop their own tech hubs.</p>
      <h3>If We Can Buy Them, We'll Make Them</h3>
      <p>Some have suggested putting the onus on tech companies to invest in educational institutions that will develop programmers here at home. Of all the suggested strategies, I think this one comes the closest to closing the gap for good.</p>
      <p>In my opinion, the solution to the problem lies in a long-term approach. We need to roll-out a fundamental overhaul to our public education system. Back when I was in high school (1999 - 2003) some of our graduation requirements included 4 years of physical education, 1 year of Home Economics, only 2 years of science, and computer science courses were un-heard of, and this was during the era of Google's big IPO.</p>
      <p>If a 4-year degree in Computer Science is what it takes to get your foot in the door, imagine what we could do with 12 years of exposure to programming. High schools could be graduating thousands of high-skilled, hire-able programmers every single year.</p>
      <h3>Let's Take A Look At The Numbers</h3>
      <p>There are currently 3.3 million students scheduled to graduate from U.S. high schools this year. If we integrated computer science courses into the curriculum starting at middle school, each student would have 8 years of programming experience under their belt by the time they graduated. Even if only 1% of those graduates met the Valley's standards for a good hire the industry would have a generous batch of 33,000 new people to pick from each year. To put that into perspective Google alone employs 46,000 people, globally</p>
      <h3>Will Changing Our Curriculum Solve The Entire Problem?</h3>
      <p>Not quite. In my opinion we'll also need to change the messages we, as a culture, send about STEM fields. Studies like this <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2014/10/17/356944145/episode-576-when-women-stopped-coding?">one</a> demonstrate how culture and media can adversely impact the rate at which women participate in STEM studies. </p>
      <p>Additionally, early access to a free programming education also has the potential to neutralize the barriers keeping racial minorities from entering the tech field. The current demographic in the tech industry is largely composed of white and Asian males which signals an opportunity to open up the labor market to a large and untapped segment of the U.S. population.</p>
