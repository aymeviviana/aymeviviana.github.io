      <h1>The Internet: A Network Of Networks</h1>
      <p class="date">04.16.2015</p>
      <p>The word “internet” came from the idea that two computers communicating with one another formed a network. If two separate computers can communicate with each other then you have two networks. Finally if you can find a way for all 4 computers to play by the same rules and communicate with one another then you have an inter network, or the internet.</p>

      <p>That’s basically what the internet is, a global network of computers sending each other messages.</p>

      <h3>How Is Communication Between Computers Made Possible?</h3>

      <p>A ton of wires. We tend to think about the internet as this weightless cloud that invisibly lingers all around us in the ether, but there’s actually a very physical component to the internet that we rarely recognize.</p> 

      <p>In addition to radio waves and satellite links, here are thousands of miles of cable sitting at the bottom of the ocean floor that make the internet possible throughout the world. For more on this fascinating topic check out this <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/andrew_blum_what_is_the_internet_really?language=en">Ted talk</a>.</p>

      <h3>Think Of The Internet As A Highway</h3>

      <p>Unless your friends live directly down the street, visiting them usually requires driving your car down a series of streets, boulevards and freeways in a path that resembles a squiggly shape more than a straight line. You can think of the messages being sent over the internet the same way. The emails, photos and files you send over the internet don’t take a direct path from one computer to another.</p> 

      <p>Instead, the internet leverage its extensive network of connected computers to find the most efficient path towards their destination. An internet message, let’s say an instant chat saying “Hi mom,” will leave your computer to travel through a cable line and make various pit stops and other computers (like servers and internet routers) along their way to your mom’s laptop.</p>

      <p>The path your “Hi mom” message takes depends on the amount of traffic it encounters on available network paths. It’s a process similar to checking out Google Maps before commuting home during rush hour. You opt for streets and freeways that pose the least amount of gridlock in order to get yourself home faster. There’s a similar decision-making process that happens with messages sent over the internet.</p>

      <h3>Traveling In Little Pieces</h3>

      <p>In fact, your internet message doesn’t even travel over the network in one piece, the way your car travels as one unit down the freeway. Your “Hi mom” messages actually gets broken down into much smaller pieces of data and each is given the destination IP address before all the individual pieces are sent on their way through the network, each taking it’s own individual path. “Hi mom” then gets reassembled into one message before arriving at your mom’s message window.</p>
