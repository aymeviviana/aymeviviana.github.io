      <h1>Asking The Right Question</h1>
      <p class="date">04.21.2015</p>
      <p>Knowing how to ask a question can be as crucial to your success as getting a good answer. Investing time and thought into your questions can feel unnecessarily tedious but can have a significant pay off if you're having a difficult time grasping a problem.</p>

      <p>In this post we'll walk through some best practices for asking a good questions.</p>
      
      <h3>1. Don't Make Any Assumptions</h3>
      <p>The person helping you out may or may not be more knowledgeable about the topic at hand. In either case, it's important not to assume that they'll immediately understand the problem you're trying to work out. They need as much information about the problem as you do, so take the time to explain the problem at an appropriate pace and in sufficient detail, which brings us to number 2...</p>

      <h3>2. Give Them Enough Detail, But Not Too Much!</h3>
      <p>While explaining the problem make sure to provide enough detail without overwhelming the other person with too much information. It's a tricky balance to strike but remember that providing irrelevant information can steer both of you off track and take up valuable mindshare that can be used for the problem you're actually trying to solve.</p>

      <h3>3. Provide Examples</h3>
      <p>There's nothing like a live example to help clear up the ambiguities in a verbal explanation. If you've got one to share, do it, otherwise consider creating an example on the spot.</p>

      <h3>4. Give Feedback</h3>
      <p>Lastly, whenever you ask a question and get an answer that helps you out, let the person know their answer helped you out. A simple gesture of gratitude goes a long way in ensuring repeated future help from others.</p>
